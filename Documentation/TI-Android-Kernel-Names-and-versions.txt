Texas Instruments Android Linux kernel releases

Kernel Name
-----------------------------------------------

Texas Instruments releases the Android kernel with associated kernel name. The kernel name consists of
<kernel major >.<kernel minor>-Android-<TI's Android project revision>.

For example:
3.0.19-Android-L4AI-R0001 denotes

Kernel Major Version: For Example 3
Kernel Minor Version: For Example 0.19
Kernel Type – Android
TI Project Minor Kernel Release – For Examle R0001

Please note that TI “Project Release” does not follow the repository's version TAG, such as L4AI.1.1.
It has it's own version with the project and can use the program's name without the version appended.

TI “Project Minor Kernel Release” changes when kernel's ABI of the major TI major subcomponent changes in such a way
that it prevents other major subcomponents to operate correctly.
For example the DSS/DSSCOMP or PM RUNTIME API or behavior change, etc.

A developer, changing a major Kernel ABI initiates the change of the kernel revision name.
The maintainer of the kernel for the respective Android project is responsible for verifying that new patches to the kernel
do not change the major API (Kernel API) in a way to break other components/modules. In case where such events arises,
the maintainer of the kernel  must initiate the revision change of the kernel name and notify the owner of the affected
components.

To change the kernel name, please update the CONFIG_LOCALVERSION filed of the kernel's respective “defconfig” file.
For Blaze, for example, the location of the file is  at /arch/arm/configs/blaze_defconfig.
As per the example above the filed would be updated as “-Android-R0001”

Texas Instruments Major Kernel Subcomponents
--------------------------------------------------

All TI kernel major subsystem APIs have:
Name, Version, Component Dependency, Component API version dependencies and API Owner.

The Name of the API has the following format TI_KERNEL_API_<API NUMBER>_<API_NAME>.

The following API are defined as of the day, this README is updated:

1. TI_KERNEL_API_01_PM RUNTIME – Kernel Power Management
2. TI_KERNEL_API_02_GFX – SGX Kernel Graphics Driver
3. TI_KERNEL_API_03_DISPLAY – DSS/DSSCOMP Display subsystem
4. TI_KERNEL_API_04_OMX – Kernel OpenMax Components
5. …..............

Kernel Power Management Subcomponent
---------------------------------------
API Name:  TI_KERNEL_API_01_PM RUNTIME
TBD

Kernel Graphics Driver Subcomponent
---------------------------------------

API Name:  TI_KERNEL_API_02_GFX
Current Version: 1.8@785978
Version Source Location: drivers/gpu/pvr/pvrversion.h
Version RT Location: /proc/pvr/version
Major Subcomponent API dependencies:
	TI_KERNEL_API_01_PM RUNTIME version xxx_tbd
	TI_KERNEL_API_03_DISPLAY  version xxx_tbd
API maintainers: Atanas (Tony) Zlatinski <zlatinski@gmail.com>, Hemant Hariyani <hemanthariyani@ti.com>

Notes: SGX kernel component are built outside the kernel tree as a kernel loadable module.
